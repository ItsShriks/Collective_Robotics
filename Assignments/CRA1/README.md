# Collaborative Robotics Sheet 1 â€“ Nakhye Ghanekar

## Overview

This project addresses Task Sheet 1 of the **Collaborative Robotics** course for Summer Semester 2025, under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Javad Ghofrani**. The  Objectives are:

- Get acquainted with scaling of response times
- Investigate a method to synchronize an asynchronous swarm
- Experience inuence of swarm connectivity/swarm density
---

## Requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.8  
- `matplotlib`  
- `networkx`  
- `numpy`  

You can install the Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx numpy
```

---

## Running the Code

Use the following commands to run each subtask:

```bash
# Subtask 1: Scaling of Data Center Response Times
python subtask1_response_scaling.py

# Subtask 2: Swarm Synchronization
python subtask2_sync_swarm.py

# Subtask 3: Influence of Swarm Connectivity
python subtask3_connectivity.py
```

Each script will generate relevant plots and output statistics to the console.

---

## Output

For each subtask, the following deliverables are included:

- **Source Code**
- **Plots** (saved to the `Plots/` directory or shown on screen)
- **This README**

---

## Submission

- Zip all files into a single file named:
  ```
  collRob_sheet1_GHANEKAR_NAKHYE.zip
  ```
- Be prepared to **present the solution in person**.
