# Collaborative Robotics Sheet 1 â€“ Ghanekar Nakhye
DLRV01_Environment_Setup_files

## Overview

This project addresses Task Sheet 1 of the **Collaborative Robotics** course for Summer Semester 2025, under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Javad Ghofrani**. The  Objectives are:

- Get acquainted with scaling of response times
- Investigate a method to synchronize an asynchronous swarm
- Experience inuence of swarm connectivity/swarm density
---

## Requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- `matplotlib`
- `networkx`
- `numpy`

You can install the Python packages using pip:

```python
pip3 install matplotlib networkx numpy
```
---

## Running the Code

Use the following commands to run each subtask:

## Subtask 1: Scaling of Data Center Response Times
```bash
python subtask1_response_scaling.py
```
## Subtask 2: Swarm Synchronization
```bash
python subtask2_sync_swarm.py
```
## Subtask 3: Influence of Swarm Connectivity
```bash
python subtask3_connectivity.py
```

Each script will generate relevant plots and output statistics to:
```
/Collective_Robotics/Assignments/CRA1/Plots
```
---

<!-- ## Output

For each subtask, the following deliverables are included:

- **Source Code**
- [Plots](./Plots/)
- **This README**

--- -->

<!-- ## Submission

- Zip all files into a single file named:
  ```
  collRob_sheet1_GHANEKAR_NAKHYE.zip
  ```
- Be prepared to **present the solution in person**. -->
