# Behavior-Based Robotics and Collective Behaviors – Simulation Tasks

This project contains a series of robotics tasks implemented using the **ARGoS** simulator, focusing on behavior-based control for both **individual robots** and **robot swarms**.

## 📁 Directory Structure & Tasks Mapping

| Folder       | Task Description                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `task1_1`    | **(2.A)** Collision avoidance for a single robot                                 |
| `task1_2`    | **(2.B)** Wall-following robot behavior                                           |
| `task1_3`    | **(2.C)** Vacuum cleaning strategy behavior                                       |
| `task2_1`    | **(3.A)** Robots stop upon close contact with another robot                       |
| `task2_2`    | **(3.B & 3.C)** Robots resume after delay, forming dynamic aggregates             |

> _Each folder contains its own ARGoS simulation with its own build instructions._

## 🔧 Build & Run Instructions (For Every Task Folder)

Each task is self-contained in its own directory. To build and run a task, follow these steps from inside the specific task folder (e.g., `cd task1_1`):

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then, to run the ARGoS simulation:

```bash
argos3 -c task1_1\task1_1.argos
```

## 🎯 Task Objectives

### Task 1: Single-Robot Behaviors

These tasks use a single robot in a rectangular, wall-bounded environment.

- **Task 1_1 (2.A)**: Collision Avoidance  
  A robot roams around while avoiding obstacles and walls using sensors.

- **Task 1_2 (2.B)**: Wall-Following  
  Robot follows the wall boundaries without making physical contact.

- **Task 1_3 (2.C)**: Vacuum Cleaner Strategy  
  Designed to cover most of the arena space efficiently, simulating a cleaning robot.

---

### Task 2: Multi-Robot Swarm Behaviors

All robots share the same control logic and are randomly distributed at simulation start.

- **Task 2_1 (3.A)**: Proximity Stop  
  Robots stop when another robot is too close. This uses simulated inter-robot distance sensing.

- **Task 2_2 (3.B & 3.C)**: Aggregation Behavior  
  Adds a timeout before robots resume movement, encouraging swarm clustering with occasional movement to avoid stagnation.

## 🧰 Simulator

All tasks are built using the [ARGoS simulator](http://www.argos-sim.info/). Make sure ARGoS is properly installed on your system before building or running these tasks.

## 📌 Notes

- Each behavior was implemented with modular and clean design in mind.
- Parameters such as distance thresholds and waiting time can be tuned in the source code or `.argos` files for better performance or experimentation.
